# Week 4 – Scheduled Logging (Looped Logging with Delay)

## Objective

Enhance your existing logging script by introducing **automation**.  
Instead of logging system info once per execution, you will now log **multiple times automatically**, with a delay between each log.

---

## Tasks

1. Collect system resource usage:
   - Timestamp
   - CPU (%)
   - Memory (%)
   - Disk (%)

2. Write each log entry to `log.csv` in the same format as Week 3.

3. Add a loop to:
   - Repeat the logging process **5 times**
   - Wait **10 seconds** between each entry

4. Each run of the script should add **5 new rows** to `log.csv`.

---

## Tools to Use

- `psutil` for system info  
- `datetime` for timestamps  
- `csv` module for writing  
- `time.sleep()` for delays  
- `for` loop to repeat logging
